# About the TG Lab CricketDispenser

If you're here, you're probably interested in the cricket hunting behavior task used by the Turrigiano lab to better understand mechanisms underlying plasticity in the developing visual system. Or maybe you just like throwing crickets at things and want a way to do it remotely.

Designing a containment and distribution system for crickets is surprisingly challenging. This is because crickets are sneaky and squeeze into cracks and crevaces to avoid their inevitable fate. Previous versions of this dispenser had a fatal flaw: crickets could escape the mechanism and fall into the arena at the wrong time, or finding their way into Gina's office where they would give their rather repetitive and chirp-y opinions on grant applications and paper revisions. While cricket chirps are a peaceful background for a fireside chat in the summer, it hits a little close to home when you're staring at a blank word document. Additionally, crickets are shockingly acrobatic and can cling to even the tiniest edge of plastic (think layer lines of a vertical 3d printed wall). 

The new dispenser needed to solve these problems:
* All-or-nothing release (no potential for a half-open chamber where crickets could hide on a tiny ledge)
* Contain the cricket in a glass tube until distribution

Some additional features carried over from the previous version:
*  Motors are distant from the behavior arena to reduce vibration and noise that could alert the mouse/rat where the next cricket will drop
*  Dispensers on opposite corners turn together (so crickets are loaded into every second chamber as a blank)
*  Dispesners are driven by an arduino that is connected to a computer

Anyway, behold: my overly complex cricket dispenser system!

# Obtaining the Materials

3d Print out the following quantites of each print in the 'design files' folder and purchase or obtain materials from dispenser part spreadsheet.

note: one corner setup, which includes a cricket cartridge and dispenser base should be able to print in ~24h on a single print bed on a Prusa i3 MK3S printer. All 4 motor case setups should also print overnight on one print print bed. 



**4x Cricket cartridge**
